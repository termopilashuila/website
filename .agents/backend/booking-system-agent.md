}
```

### Conversion Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Booking abandonment prevention
class BookingOptimizer {
  static preventAbandonment() {
    // Save booking progress in localStorage
    this.saveBookingProgress();
    
    // Show exit-intent popup with incentive
    this.setupExitIntentPopup();
    
    // Implement booking timeout warnings
    this.setupTimeoutWarnings();
  }
  
  static saveBookingProgress() {
    const bookingData = this.getCurrentBookingData();
    localStorage.setItem('booking_progress', JSON.stringify({
      data: bookingData,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      step: this.getCurrentStep()
    }));
  }
  
  static showUpsellOffers(bookingData) {
    const offers = this.getRelevantOffers(bookingData);
    offers.forEach(offer => {
      this.displayOffer(offer);
    });
  }
}
```

    const demandMultiplier = this.getDemandMultiplier(dates, occupancy);
    const seasonalMultiplier = this.getSeasonalMultiplier(dates);
    const competitorAdjustment = this.getCompetitorAdjustment(dates);
    
    return Math.round(
      basePrice * demandMultiplier * seasonalMultiplier * competitorAdjustment
    );
  }
  
  static getDemandMultiplier(dates, currentOccupancy) {
    if (currentOccupancy > 0.8) return 1.3;
    if (currentOccupancy > 0.6) return 1.15;
    if (currentOccupancy > 0.4) return 1.0;
    return 0.9; // Low occupancy discount
  }
}
```

### Upselling Integration
```javascript
// Experience and service upselling
const upsellOffers = {
  cacoaTour: {
    name: 'Tour de Cacao Artesanal',
    price: 45000,

```

## Quality Assurance and Testing

### Booking Flow Testing
```javascript
// Automated booking process testing
class BookingSystemTester {
  static async runDailyTests() {
    const testResults = [];
    
    // Test availability search
    testResults.push(await this.testAvailabilitySearch());
    
    // Test booking process
    testResults.push(await this.testBookingFlow());
    
    // Test payment processing
    testResults.push(await this.testPaymentProcessing());
    
    // Test confirmation emails
    testResults.push(await this.testConfirmationEmails());
    
    return this.generateTestReport(testResults);
  }
  
  static async testBookingFlow() {
    try {
      // Simulate complete booking process
      const searchResult = await this.searchAvailability();
      const roomSelection = await this.selectRoom(searchResult.rooms[0]);
      const guestInfo = await this.fillGuestInformation();
      const paymentResult = await this.processTestPayment();
      
      return { success: true, flow: 'complete' };
    } catch (error) {
      return { success: false, error: error.message };
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Real-time performance tracking
class BookingPerformanceMonitor {
  static trackLoadTimes() {
    const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
      list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.name.includes('booking')) {
          this.logPerformanceMetric({
            name: entry.name,
            duration: entry.duration,
            timestamp: Date.now()
          });
          
          if (entry.duration > 3000) {
            this.alertSlowPerformance(entry);
          }
        }
      });
    });
    
    observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['navigation', 'resource'] });
