## Key Monitoring Areas

### Core Web Vitals Tracking

Current implementation includes service worker for performance optimization. Recommended Core Web Vitals tracking:

```javascript
// Performance monitoring implementation (to be added)
const performanceObserver = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      gtag('event', 'web_vitals', {
        event_category: 'performance',
        event_label: 'LCP',
        value: Math.round(entry.startTime)
      });
    }
  });
});

performanceObserver.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint'] });

// Track First Input Delay (FID)
new PerformanceObserver((entryList) => {
  entryList.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
    gtag('event', 'web_vitals', {
      event_category: 'performance',
      event_label: 'FID',
      value: Math.round(entry.processingStart - entry.startTime)
    });
  });
}).observe({ entryTypes: ['first-input'] });

// Track Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
let clsValue = 0;
new PerformanceObserver((entryList) => {
  entryList.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
    if (!entry.hadRecentInput) {
      clsValue += entry.value;
      gtag('event', 'web_vitals', {
        event_category: 'performance',
        event_label: 'CLS',
        value: Math.round(clsValue * 1000)
      });
    }
  });
}).observe({ entryTypes: ['layout-shift'] });
```

### Current Event Tracking Implementation

The website currently implements comprehensive event tracking across all major user interactions:

```javascript
// Current event tracking examples from the codebase

// Newsletter subscriptions
gtag('event', 'form_submission', {
  'event_category': 'newsletter',
  'event_label': 'newsletter_subscription'
});

// Event registrations (wine tasting events)
gtag('event', 'cata_vino_paella_tapas_registration', {
  'event_category': 'event_engagement',
  'event_label': 'registration_complete',
  'value': 120000,
  'currency': 'COP'
});

// WhatsApp contact tracking with UTM parameters
gtag('event', 'whatsapp_redirect', {
  'event_category': 'engagement',
  'event_label': 'WhatsApp Redirect Page',
  'utm_source': params.utm_source,
  'utm_medium': params.utm_medium,
  'utm_campaign': params.utm_campaign,
  'phone_number': params.phone
});

// Blog engagement tracking
gtag('event', 'blog_newsletter_subscription', {
  'event_category': 'Lead Generation',
  'event_label': 'Newsletter Subscription',
  'page': window.location.pathname
});

// Scroll depth tracking
gtag('event', 'cata_vino_paella_tapas_scroll_75', {
  'event_category': 'event_engagement',
  'event_label': 'scroll_depth_75percent'
});
```

### Octorate Booking System Integration

```javascript
// Recommended booking funnel tracking for Octorate integration
const trackBookingStep = (step, bookingData) => {
  gtag('event', 'begin_checkout', {
    currency: 'COP',
    value: bookingData.totalAmount,
    items: [{
      item_id: bookingData.roomId,
      item_name: bookingData.roomName,
      category: 'accommodation',
      quantity: bookingData.nights,
      price: bookingData.pricePerNight
    }]
  });
};

// Track booking completion
gtag('event', 'purchase', {
  transaction_id: bookingData.transactionId,
  value: bookingData.totalAmount,
  currency: 'COP',
  items: bookingData.items
});
```
