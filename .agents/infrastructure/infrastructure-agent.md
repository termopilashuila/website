      condition: "error_rate > 5%"
      notification: "critical"
```

## Security Configuration

### SSL/TLS and Security Headers
```nginx
# Nginx security configuration
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name termopilas.co;
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/termopilas.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/termopilas.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
    
    # Security headers
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' *.google.com *.googleapis.com";
    
    # Gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/css application/javascript application/json text/xml;
    
    location / {
        root /var/www/termopilas;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

### Backup and Disaster Recovery
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated backup script

BACKUP_DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="/backups/termopilas_$BACKUP_DATE"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup website files
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/website_files.tar.gz" /var/www/termopilas/

# Backup configuration files
cp -r /etc/nginx/sites-available/ "$BACKUP_DIR/nginx_config/"
cp -r /etc/ssl/ "$BACKUP_DIR/ssl_certificates/"

# Backup to cloud storage
gsutil cp -r "$BACKUP_DIR" gs://termopilas-backups/

# Clean up old backups (keep last 30 days)
find /backups -type d -name "termopilas_*" -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \;

# Verify backup integrity
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup completed successfully: $BACKUP_DIR"
else
    echo "Backup failed" | mail -s "Backup Failure Alert" admin@termopilas.co
fi
```

## Performance Optimization

### CDN and Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Service Worker for caching strategy
const CACHE_NAME = 'termopilas-v1';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/styles/main.css',
  '/styles/main-sections.css',
  '/assets/images/logo.png'
];

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then((cache) => cache.addAll(urlsToCache))
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then((response) => {
        // Return cached version or fetch from network
        return response || fetch(event.request);
      })
  );
});
```

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Database performance optimization queries
-- Index optimization for booking queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_date_range ON bookings(check_in_date, check_out_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_availability_room_date ON availability(room_id, date);

-- Query optimization for availability searches
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT r.*, a.available_rooms 
FROM rooms r 
JOIN availability a ON r.id = a.room_id 
WHERE a.date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
AND a.available_rooms > 0;
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Resource Scaling Policies
```json
{
  "autoScaling": {
    "minInstances": 1,
    "maxInstances": 5,
    "targetCPUUtilization": 70,
    "scaleUpCooldown": 300,
    "scaleDownCooldown": 600
  },
  "scheduling": {
    "lowTrafficPeriods": {
      "hours": "02:00-06:00",
      "instances": 1,
      "machineType": "e2-micro"
    },
    "peakTrafficPeriods": {
      "hours": "18:00-22:00", 
      "instances": 3,
      "machineType": "e2-standard-2"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cost Monitoring and Alerts
```python
# Cost monitoring script
import google.cloud.billing_v1 as billing

def monitor_infrastructure_costs():
    client = billing.CloudBillingClient()
    project_id = "termopilas-website"
    
    # Get current month billing
    current_costs = get_current_month_costs(client, project_id)
    
    # Alert if costs exceed budget
    monthly_budget = 200  # USD
    if current_costs > monthly_budget * 0.8:
        send_cost_alert(current_costs, monthly_budget)
    
    # Identify optimization opportunities
    optimization_suggestions = analyze_cost_optimization(client, project_id)
    
    return {
        'current_costs': current_costs,
        'budget_utilization': current_costs / monthly_budget,
        'optimization_suggestions': optimization_suggestions
    }
```

## Escalation Procedures

### Critical Infrastructure Issues
- Complete website outage → Activate disaster recovery procedures
- Security breach detected → Implement incident response plan
- Data loss or corruption → Restore from latest backup immediately
- Performance degradation > 50% → Emergency optimization procedures

### Capacity and Scaling Issues
- Traffic spike beyond scaling capacity → Manual resource provisioning
- Database performance degradation → Query optimization and scaling
- CDN failures or slowdowns → Alternative CDN activation
- SSL certificate expiration → Emergency certificate renewal

### Cost and Resource Issues
- Monthly budget exceeded by 50% → Resource optimization review
- Unexpected cost spikes → Resource audit and optimization
- Scaling failures → Manual intervention and configuration review
- Resource constraints → Capacity planning and upgrade assessment
