python main.py

# Resize a specific image (from project root):
python main.py assets/images/blog/nibs-cacao-parfait-bowl/featured-image.jpg --width=400 --quality=50

# Resize all images in a specific directory:
python main.py ../assets/images/coliving --width=600 --quality=80

# Run the script from inside the resize directory:
cd resize
python main.py
```

### Using npm (Legacy method)

```bash
